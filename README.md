# Random-League-Team-Disc-Bot

Quick little discord bot that generates random champions for league of legends teams. It uses the discord.py api to read messages in a server, and if the message matches the regex string, sends a message containing two teams. 

Depending on what the discord bot is named the message will look something like this.
